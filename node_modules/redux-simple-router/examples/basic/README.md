This is a basic example that demonstrates rendering components based
on URLs with react-router as well as connecting them to Redux state.
It uses both <Link> elements and the `updatePath` action creator to
update the paths.

To run, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` (make sure it creates a local node_modules)
2. Build with `webpack --watch`
3. Open `index.html`
