# Goal: get YOU writing React code

...and hopefully enjoy it.













# Casual, mostly free time

For the first few lessons, I'll walk you through slowly, but then
I'll let you all mostly just work and walk around to help.

If you already mostly know React, you can skip to the Advanced
lessons.

 









# 1.5 hours is short!

A full react/redux workshop would take a day or two. We can't go too
deep, and probably will only get to dip our toes into Redux.
