<h2>Prompts</h2>

<h3>Authentication Prompts</h3>
<p>Use authentication prompts when websites require that users sign in to access any content from the server.</p>

<h3>Modal Prompts</h3>
<p>Use modal prompts when a user must interact with the dialog before further interactions with the application or website can occur.  There are two types of modal prompts:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Tab modal, where the prompt appears anchored beneath the awesome bar. </li>
<li>Application modal, where the prompt appears over the awesome bar, anchored to the top chrome. </li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>When more than prompt must be addressed, indicate the total number in the upper corner of the prompt and surface the next one in sequence as the user completes the previous one.</p>

<h3>Notification Bars</h3>

<p>Use notification bars to inform users of informational, urgent, or emergency states in the browser that donâ€™t require user interaction. Assume anything in these bars could be missed or dismissed without reading.
