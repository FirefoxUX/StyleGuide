  <div class="block2 welcome"><p>Firefox offers users a great deal of control over things like privacy, security, and customization.  This means that the user experience can be highly personal and idiosyncratic. Our products need to support this, but we still want them to look, feel and sound like they come from the same place and share the same spirit.</p>

  <p>That’s why we’ve created these guidelines. Having a consistent appearance and voice builds credibility and trust for people who use Firefox. Having well-articulated values and well-documented standards also makes decisions easier for people who design for Firefox.</p>

  <p>Whether you are building an add-on, designing a new feature or writing support copy, we hope these guidelines help you use Firefox design principles and systems in your own work.</p></div>
