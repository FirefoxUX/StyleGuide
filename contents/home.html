<h2>Welcome to the Firefox Style Guide</h2>

<p>This guide is targetted at three main groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add-on Authors <small>who want to write Firefox-y add-ons.</small></li>
  <li>Designers <small>who want to make mockups of new features that
    look like they belong in Firefox</small></li>
  <li>and Firefox Engineers <small>who want to make sure that the new
    features they’re adding fit in with the rest of the application.</small></li>
</ol>

<p>Each of the sections on the left contains the pieces you might use, as
  well as example code you can include in your own project, and the rationale
  behind the designs, so feel free to click around and discover what’s there.</p>

<p>We’ve also collected all the recommendations for Add-on Authors into
  <a href="#/home/addons">a single page</a>, for ease
  of reference.</p>
