<h2>Localization</h2>

<p>Firefox products are developed for a global audience. More than 70 percent of Firefox users live outside of North America. Our products are localized for more than 80 languages and regional dialects.</p>

<p>Meeting the needs of our users around the world and working to inject more Firefox personality into copy will always be a balancing act. Copy with idioms, humor or complex sentence structures may pose challenges for localizers; your pithy English phrase may be misunderstood, or require 50 percent more copy to translate effectively. Worse, it may simply not be appropriate for a region’s sensibilities. The good news is that writing well for the web – short sentences, clear hierarchy, non-ambiguous language – will go far to support our localization efforts. Visit the localization team’s wiki for more advice on the specifics of writing for localization.</p>

<p>Localization is a partnership between writer, developer, and localizer. Be open to feedback from developers about copy structure. (View these guidelines for a bit of insight into how developers account for localization in code.</p>
