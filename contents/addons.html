<h3>Add-on Presentation</h3>

<p>Present add-ons in a way that describes their functionality in clear terms.
This involves choosing a descriptive name for the add-on, including demonstrative screenshots, and making the description understandable.  For bonus
points, try to make the description conform to <a
href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/communications/copy-tone/"
>Mozilla’s copy tone</a>.</p>


<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Keep your images up to date. If they show OS elements make sure it is a
current version of a well known OS (such as the latest versions of Windows or
Mac OS X). This will reassure your potential users that this add-on is up to
date.</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>On installing an add-on the user will see a panel indicating the add-on has
been installed. This panel will be placed underneath the icon of the add-on. If
the add-on does not have a visual representation, the panel will be placed
underneath the menu button.<br><small>This is a lie.  We actually show the panel
underneath the add-on icon in the urlbar, if I’m remembering
correctly…</small></p>


<h3>Browser Action</h3>
<small>(related to <a
href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction"
>chrome.browserAction</a>)</small>

<p>Use browserActions to put a button in the main Mozilla Firefox toolbar. Per
default this button will be placed to the right of the address bar. However, the
user is free to move this button to multiple locations in the browser.   In
addition to its button, a browserAction should also have a tooltip, and can
have a badge, a panel and can be highlighted.</p>


<h4>Button</h4>

<p>A browserAction button is represented by an icon. Its states are defined by
Firefox and will be adapted to match the operating system. Besides those states
a button can be highlighted to indicate important events.</p>


<h4>Icon</h4>

<p>The icon should be clear and distinguishable in one color. To keep a clean
appearance within Firefox and match individual OSs we will color the SVG
provided in the same color as other toolbar icons. The icon should be 16×16px
outline SVG. For compatibility with Chrome/Opera we will also support full color
images but strongly recommend matching your icon’s color with native icons. If
the user moves the button to the menu panel the icon</p>

<h5>Icon Sizes</h5>
<table>
  <tr><td>URL Bar</td><td>12x12 px</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Toolbar</td><td>16x16 px</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Menu Panel</td><td>32x32 px</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Display Icon</td><td>64x64 px</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>States</h4>

<p>Browser actions as other buttons have different appearances indicating their state.</p>

<table>
  <tr><td>enabled</td>
  <td>Basic state of a button if it’s function is available.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>disabled</td>
  <td>Basic state of a button if it’s function is not available.<br>Should not
  be needed on a browserAction as they should work all the time. If it does not,
  consider if it should rather be a pageAction.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>hover (if not disabled)</td>
  <td>Controlled by Firefox. Can not be influenced by an add-on.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>active (if not disabled)</td>
  <td>Controlled by Firefox. Can not be influenced by an add-on.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>highlighted</td>
  <td>To indicate an important active state of a browserAction you can set it to
  be highlighted. This will color the icon blue until the state is resolved.
  (e.g. set Bookmark or finished Download)<br>Can only be used if the icon is
  provided as an SVG</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>Locations</h4>

<p>A browserAction by default is placed in the toolbar to the right of the
address bar. The user can however move it to any other location in the toolbar,
the bookmark toolbar, or the menu panel. In the menu panel the content specified
to be displayed in the popup will be displayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>in Toolbar (default)</li>
  <li>in Menu Panel</li>
  <li>in Bookmark Toolbar</li>
</ul>


<h4>Tooltip</h4>

<p>Users should be able to understand what will happen when they click the
button. Therefore the tooltip will describe what the button does by clearly
stating the action that will be performed on click. (Do not just put the name of
the add-on in the tooltip, unless it is very descriptive of the action the
button will perform!)</p>


<h4>Badge</h4>

<p>Use sparingly to inform users about important events.</p>

<p>Can be up to 4 characters and will not extend beyond the borders of the
button.  We recommend using one of four states provided for different severity
of notifications: Info (grey #ebebeb), Casual (blue #0996f8), Warning (red
#d92215), and Update (green #57bd35).</p>

<p>For compatibility with Chrome/Opera we will also support free color
selection, recommend however usage of Firefox defaults to keep consistency.</p>


<h4>Panel</h4>

<p>Use a panel if your browserAction provides the user with multiple actions or
displays an other form of content on request. To best integrate with Firefox
make sure to align the content of the panel with our recommended styles.</p>

<h5>Requirements:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Width of 300px or greater</li>
</ul>

<h5>Optional:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Display Icon</li>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Dialog</li>
  <li>List</li>
  <li>Buttons</li>
  <li>Inputs</li>
  <li>Checkbox</li>
  <li>Radio Buttons</li>
</ul>


<h4>Tips</h4>

<p>For the best visual impact, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use browserActions for features that make sense on most pages.</li>
  <li>Don't use browserActions for features that make sense for only a few
    pages.<br>Use pageActions instead.</li>
  <li>Use SVG icons that blend well with the other icons in Firefox.</li>
</ul>
